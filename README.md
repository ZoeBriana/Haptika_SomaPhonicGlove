# Haptika_SomaPhonicGlove
The SomaPhonic Glove kit gradually challenges the user to work with multiple sense points and introduces audio as a mechanism for remix and redefinition. The kit uses copper tape to sense when certain points are in contact with skin. This kit has been designed to allow for each finger to act like an instrument by triggering different sounds or audio samples. The purpose of this project is to redefine trauma landmarks on the body by revisiting these places and remapping the trauma-infused cartography. This project aims to equip the user with the means to RE-Member places on their body that could trigger trauma flashbacks. The project allows the user to be empowered to change the meaning of this place by making it an instrument for play and exploration, all the while practicing established embodied practices such as tapping and intentional gesture. http://www.haptika.co/portfolios/the-somaphonic-glove/
